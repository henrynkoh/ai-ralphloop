## Part 1: Using the app (5 min)

### Step 1 — Open the app

After running `npm run dev`, open **http://localhost:3000**.

### Step 2 — Understand the home page

- You see **7 categories** in order (1 → 7).
- Each card shows: category number, title, short description, and number of concepts.
- **“How to use this curriculum”** at the bottom explains the recommended order.

### Step 3 — Open a category

- Click **“Category 1: Founder Readiness & Mindset”**.
- You get a **table** with columns: **Concept** | **Key idea** | **Step-by-step instructions** | **Notes**.
- Use the steps in the third column as your checklist.

### Step 4 — Use “Full curriculum”

- Click **“Full curriculum”** in the header (or go to `/all`).
- All 7 categories and every concept appear in one scrollable page.
- Use this for reference or to print/export.

## Part 2: Following the curriculum (by category)

Do the categories in order. For each concept, follow the steps in the table.

| Category | What you’ll do (high level) |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| **1. Founder Readiness & Mindset** | Define purpose, reframe failure, use design thinking, pick one problem to solve, adopt founder mindset, invest in yourself. |
| **2. Opportunity Discovery & Validation** | Write a testable assumption, find where users are, do 10–20 discovery conversations, validate with a landing page or pre-sale (aim for 10–20 committed leads). |
| **3. Business Model & Definition** | Fill a Business Model Canvas or Lean Canvas, define one segment and one value proposition, choose a revenue model. |
| **4. MVP & Build–Measure–Learn** | Choose your riskiest assumption, pick the cheapest MVP type (e.g. landing page, concierge), run Build–Measure–Learn, write hypotheses for each experiment. |
| **5. Build & Launch** | Choose tech stack and infrastructure (hosting, payments, auth), handle legal when it reduces risk, get your first customers manually. |
| **6. Growth & Product–Market Fit** | Track retention and PMF signals, iterate with one north-star metric, improve onboarding, do “build in public” and SEO, lock naming and messaging. |
| **7. Tools & Operations** | Set up no-code or code stack, payments, auth, and distribution (Product Hunt, X, Indie Hackers); use AI for copy and support where helpful. |

## Part 3: Weekly rhythm (suggestion)

- **Week 1–2:** Categories 1–2 (mindset + validation).
- **Week 3:** Category 3 (business model).
- **Week 4:** Category 4 (MVP + first experiment).
- **Week 5+:** Categories 5–7 (build, launch, grow) while revisiting earlier steps as needed.

## Part 4: Tips

- **Don’t skip validation.** Use the step-by-step in Category 2 before building.
- **One segment first.** Use the “Target customer & value proposition” concept in Category 3 to pick one segment and one sentence.
- **Reuse “Full curriculum.”** Bookmark `/all` for quick lookup without redundancy.
