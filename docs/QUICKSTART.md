## Summary: How to do (from video transcripts)

*From the Ralph Loop video: 반복 가능한 작업 시스템으로 품질 올리기.*

- **In short:** Good prompts → repeat execution → file/markdown history (or tests) → improve by process quality. Trust file state over context; 20–60 min task units; clear completion conditions.
- **Steps:** (1) Write clear completion conditions, (2) Run in loops and save to files/history, (3) Commit or ping-pong at task unit, (4) Check commit and test each cycle; adjust prompt and restart if direction wrong.
- **Remember:** You’re operator/quality designer; no end condition = infinite loop won’t yield good quality. See [VIDEO_TRANSCRIPT_SUMMARY.md](./VIDEO_TRANSCRIPT_SUMMARY.md) for full summary.
